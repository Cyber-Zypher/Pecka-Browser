# Pecka-Browser
An Open Source Web Browser Built with Python.
Pecka uses PyQt5, QtWebEngine and some other packages to run.
Pecka itself developed from and existing open-source project but I'm allowing anyone to use this code in their project. We do also have a YouTube Channel, Don't forget to subscribe to that. link: https://www.youtube.com/c/cyberzypher This project is licensed under GNU Public License. Thank You!
